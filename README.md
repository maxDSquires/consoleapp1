First console homework assignment

Requires us to create a console app that displays 4 options to pick from, allow a user to input a choice, parse that choice and display error messages if it is either not a number or an invalid choice, then display a result based on the choice made.

Assignment Purpose: Learn to create a user interface in a Console Application.

Note: Refer to the samples demonstrated in class or search the internet  

Project Purpose: One of the later assignments is another Console Application. It requires 2 ‘Menus’ to allow the user to identify which of 2 text files to read and the other menu to allow the user to sort and search the data reqd from the text file.

    To do this you will need to …
    
o	Create 1 text string as the last menu item (#4).						                                5 pts		 

o	Create 3 other text strings for items #1-3 (Your choice on what they say. 			            15 pts

o	Create a ‘prompt’ (like a label in a Windows Form application. 				                      5 pts

o	Accept keyboard input from the user.							                                          5 pts

o	You must validate that the keyed entry is a number.						                              5 pts

o	If the number is between 1 & 4, call a user defined method named Pause that waits for the
user to press any key.									                                                      5 pts

o	If the keyed entry is number, but not 1-4, tell the user that their entry was invalid.		  5 pts

o	If the keyed entry is NOT a number, tell the user that their entry is NOT A NUMBER.	        5 pts
